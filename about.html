<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm a 19-year-old student from Pune, currently pursuing dual degrees: a BE in Information Technology from DY Patil College of Engineering and a BSc in Data Science and Programming from IIT Madras. Highly enthusiastic and selectively extroverted, I have a knack for making people around me laugh and enjoy creating a positive atmosphere. I love working in teams, as collaboration brings out the best in me and helps achieve better results.</p>

<p>I enjoy playing badminton and cricket, both of which keep me active and energized. Music is my constant companion, helping me unwind and stay motivated. I also consider sleeping and laughing to be my absolute favorite activitiesâ€”they keep me refreshed and bring joy to my everyday life</p>
